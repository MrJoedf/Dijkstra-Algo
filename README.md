## Installation

To use this application, you need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. You can download the latest JDK from the official Oracle website.

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the Java source code using the command: `javac scratch/DijkstraApp.java`
3. Run the compiled application using the command: `java scratch.DijkstraApp`

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running the compiled `DijkstraApp` class.
2. The application window will open, showing an empty canvas.
3. Left-click on the canvas to create nodes in the graph. Each node will be labeled with a letter identifier.
4. Right-click on the canvas to clear the selected node and any shortest path.
5. To set distances between nodes, click the "Set Distance" button and follow the prompts to select source and destination nodes, and enter the distance.
6. To find the shortest path between two nodes, click the "Show Shortest Path" button and follow the prompts to select the source and destination nodes.
7. The shortest path will be displayed in green on the canvas.
